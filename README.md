# Sales-Inventory-Management-System
As an aspiring SQL developer, I undertook a comprehensive data analysis project to demonstrate proficiency in the entire data lifecycle, from ingestion and cleaning to advanced visualization.

Using Python and the Faker library, I generated a robust, synthetic e-commerce dataset to simulate real-world scenarios. This hands-on experience provided invaluable insights into data integrity, structure, and the critical importance of a clean data source.

I then designed and forward-engineered a relational database schema in MySQL Workbench to efficiently store the data. This foundational step ensured data consistency and enabled complex querying. Subsequently, I developed a suite of targeted SQL queries to extract key business insights on customer value, popular products, and sales trends.

The final phase involved connecting the cleaned and structured data to Power BI. I leveraged my SQL insights to build an interactive dashboard, visually representing monthly sales performance, valuable customer segments, and supplier contributions. This project effectively showcases my ability to not only write code but also to translate raw data into actionable business intelligence.
